		<h1>Class decoration</h1>
		
		<p>Class decoration is implemented in a very simple way. Based on
		the settings (test case prefixes and suffixes) MoreUnit tries to find a
		matching class in the underlying project. If for instance "Test" is an
		element of your test case suffix list (this is the default setting on
		first installation) Foo will be marked with a small green icon in the
		package explorer if a class named FooTest exists in the underlying
		project.</p>
		
		<p>Decoration is disabled by default. You have to enable label
		decoration via WINDOWS &rarr; PREFERENCES &rarr; GENERAL &rarr;
		APPEARANCE &rarr; LABEL DECORATIONS &rarr; DECORATE CLASSES WITH TEST
		CASE.</p>
		
		
		<h1>Marker in the editor</h1>
		
		<p>After installing and configuring MoreUnit you can see markers in
		the editor, while coding. If a method has a test method, a green marker
		will appear in the vertical ruler.</p>
		
		<p>If you want MoreUnit markers to appear in the overview ruler or
		if you want to disable markers in the editor this can be done via the
		annotation preferences of Eclipse.</p>
		
		
		<h1>Switching between test and class under test</h1>
		
		<p>You can jump from java classes which are open in the editor to
		the corresponding test cases via the contextual menu of the editor or
		via the shortcut "Ctrl"+"J". MoreUnit identifies the name of the class
		under the cursor. To find the corresponding test case the prefixes and
		suffixes from the preferences are used. If exactly one test case is
		found the file gets opened. If more than one test case is found a dialog
		is shown and prompts you to choose which test case you want to work on.</p>
		
		<p>If no test case is found the test case wizard is shown,
		initialized with the settings from the preference page.</p>
		
		<p>MoreUnit also tries to identify the test method(s) corresponding
		to the method under the cursor and directly jumps to it if only one is
		found.<br />
		Example: For a method named "addTree" tests named "testAddTree" or
		"testAddTreeSUFFIX" will be detected as test method.</p>
		
		<p>Also, if you activated the extended method search, a test method
		that calls your method will be found, whatever its name.<br />
		Finally, please note that jumping also works the other way, to go back
		to your production code.</p>
		
		<p>The shortcuts for the jump/generate action are configurable. If
		you want to change the default keys go to WINDOW &rarr; PREFERENCES...
		&rarr; GENERAL &rarr; KEYS and change the settings of the commands named
		"Create Test Method" and "Jump to Test".</p>
		
		
		<h1>Test case/test method creation</h1>
		
		<p>To generate a test-method stub choose "Generate Test Method" from the
		pop-up menu within an editor. MoreUnit identifies the method under the
		cursor and generates a test method stub. At first MoreUnit tries to find
		a test case for the underlying resource (if you want to know how this is
		done, take a look above at "Jump to test"). If no test case is found the
		test case wizard is shown. If the method under the cursor is named
		"amethodname" the generated test method will be name "testAmethodname",
		assuming you defined "test" as a prefix in MoreUnit preferences. If
		MoreUnit detects a test method with this name no method stub is
		generated.</p>
		
		<p>MoreUnit doesn't jump to the test method automatically so you
		have to jump to the test case if you want to edit it.<br />
		The shortcuts for the jump/generate action are configurable. If you want
		to change the default keys go to WINDOW &rarr; PREFERENCES... &rarr;
		GENERAL &rarr; KEYS and change the settings of the commands named
		"Create Test Method" and "Jump to Test".</p>
		
		<p>If you use the "Generate Test Method" action on a test method MoreUnit
		creates a second test method.</p>
		
		
		<h1>Running a test from class under test</h1>
		
		<p>If you have a class under test you can run the corresponding test
		case class(es) directly from this class by hitting Ctrl+R.</p>
		
		
		<h1>View for missing test methods</h1>
		
		<p>MoreUnit offers a view to show the methods of the classes you are
		working on which do not have a test method yet. To use this view just
		open it: WINDOW &rarr; SHOW VIEW &rarr; OTHER... &rarr; MISSING TEST
		METHODS.<br />
		This view offers 3 features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Filter private methods</li>
			<li>Filter getter/setter</li>
			<li>Create test methods for selected methods</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h1>Refactoring support</h1>
		
		<p>MoreUnit offers some refactoring support. If you rename a class
		and a corresponding test case exists MoreUnit will rename it too. You
		can take a look at the refactoring preview. For methods there is a
		similar behavior: if you rename a method having one or more
		corresponding test methods, then all those methods are renamed
		accordingly. Lastly, if you move a class to a different package MoreUnit
		will move the corresponding tests as well.</p>
